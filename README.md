# libgdx-tower-defense

A basic tower defense game built in LibGDX

## What is this?

This is just a basic tower defense game. It's not very different from any other
tower defense game out there.

## Why?

This was created for two reasons:
1. To learn more about game development, game engines, and graphics.
2. There seems a surprising lack of tower defense games on the F-Droid store.
   
## Platforms

* GNU+Linux
* Android
* Windows

There's a potential for any of the other platforms LibGDX supports, but
Desktop and Android are the focus.

## Is it playable?

Not really, it's in the very early stages of infancy. It's riddled with bugs and lacking
a lot of very important features.

## How do I build/run it?

### Dependencies
* Java (1.8)
* Gradle
* LibGDX
* Android SDK

### Commands

To build and run on **Linux** or **Windows**:
`./gradlew desktop:run`

To build and install for **Android***:
`./gradlew installDebug`
