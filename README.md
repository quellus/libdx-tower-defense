# libgdx-tower-defense

A basic tower defense game build in LibGDX

## What is this?

This is your run of the mill tower defense game. It does not really have any
features that make it defense from any other tower defense game.

## Why?

Two reasons:
1. I want to learn more about game development, game engines, and graphics.
2. There's a surprising lack of tower defense games on the F-Droid store and I
   want to fix that.
   
## Platforms

* Linux
* Windows
* Android (Coming soon!)

There's a potential for any of the other platforms LibGDX supports, but
Desktop and Android are the focus.

## Is it playable?

No, it's in the very early stages of infancy. It's riddled with bugs and lacking
a lot of very important features.

## How do I build/run it?

### Dependencies
* Java
* Gradle
* LibGDX

### Commands
On Linux you would use this command to run the desktop version:
`./gradlew desktop:run`

When an Android version is added the following command will build that:
`./gradlew android:run`
